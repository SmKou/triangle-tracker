Demonstration web app for identifying types of triangles.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS (ES6)

## Description

Triangle Tracker uses a form collect the lengths of the sides of a triangle from a user, and then determines if these lengths can form a triangle. If they do, it will determine if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. There are two versions of the scripts.js, one without use of any arrays or loops, switch statements, or arrow functions, and the alternative, which is refactored to reduce code size and incorporate the unused features of JavaScript.

Triangle Tracker includes a subproject named Age Difference, which uses a form to collect a human age and a pet's age, then displays the difference to the user.
